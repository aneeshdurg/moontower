put that knowledge together into a pretty cool [webapp](/~aneesh/chat) and along
the way I've found some "best practices" that I think is worth sharing!

overcome in terms of configuring the site (and the CGI server in particular)
that most users shouldn't have to deal with.

## File structure
## Using SQLite and managing dependencies
## Streaming events
## Managing processes
