title: Was it worth the cheese?

---

Recently I learned a new idiom and wanted to write about it.

A friend recently told me about an idiom in french that translates to "was it
worth the cheese?". This is in reference to a folktale about a fox and a raven
which supposedly goes as follows:

> A fox encounters a raven holding a piece of cheese in it's beak.
> 
> "Wow Raven, you look stunning today", said the fox.
> 
> "Gee thanks", mumbled the raven through the cheese.
> 
> "Your plume looks great, and what a stunning beak. I would love to hear you sing
> a song!", said the fox.
> 
> The raven blushed, and as the raven opened it's beak to sing, the fox snatched
> the cheese and ate it.
> 
> "The flatterer is not the one who pays for the flattery. I hope this lesson was
> worth the cheese", quipped the fox as it ran off into the woods, leaving behind
> a sad, cheeseless, but hopefully wiser, raven.

In short, the idiom, "was it worth the cheese?" asks if a bad situation was
worth the lessons learned from it. It is, of course, preferable to be wise from
the start and keep your cheese, but hindsight is always 20/20, and it often
takes lived experiences to recognize undesirable situations.
